## 🌟 Featured Projects

### Audio Processing Panel
Developed a Python-based user interface for digital audio processing. Features include:
- Voice recording
- Spectral analysis
- Noise removal
- Compression and equalization
- Audio classification (Jazz/Metal/HiP-Hop...)
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis

This project showcases my expertise in Python programming and audio signal processing.

### Smart Air Conditioner Controller
Designed a Python-based system to automate server room air conditioning:
- Utilized a Raspberry Pi and DHT22 sensors for temperature monitoring and control.
- Simulated actuator functionality using LEDs.

### Temperature and Gas Detector 🚨
An Arduino-based safety monitoring system that:
- **Features:**
  - Monitors ambient temperature.
  - Detects harmful gases like LPG, methane, or carbon monoxide.
  - Alerts via an LED and buzzer when thresholds are exceeded.
- **Components Used:**
  - Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
  - Temperature sensor (e.g., LM35, DHT11, DHT22)
  - Gas sensor (e.g., MQ-2, MQ-5, MQ-7)
  - LEDs, buzzer, resistors, and connecting wires.

Ideal for safety monitoring in homes, offices, and workshops.
